	a. Add things to the local repository:	git add .
	
		or if you want to add a single file/folder: git add <name of file/folder>
		
	(bear in mind that those files/folders should ALREADY be inside the local
	repository directory.
	
	and then:	git commit -m "some message"

	This commits the changes to the local repository, in the sense that if you want to go
	back to this stage you always can; each "commit" is a snapshot.

	and finally to push to the cloud:	git push origin master
	
	then, to pull from the cloud:	git pull
	
	all the previous commands should be executed inside the local repository directory!!!

	b. To clone a repository:
	
	git clone <web address of the repository>

	c. To check branch: git status
	c1. To change branch: git checkout <name of target branch>

	d. EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO CLONE TO NEW MACHINE YOU HAVE TO CREATE AN AUTHENTICATION
	   A SIGNING KEY (LOOK GIT DOCUMENTATION)
