In order to carry out the comparison we need:

1. A pure-gauge ensemble of 240 configurations, with plaquette action, 16^3*24, beta=6.0.
   Coulomb gauge has to be fixed on the configurations.

2. To implement the evolution equation:

   G_[x,t+1] = U4_[dag;x,t] * { ( 1 + DD/4M )^2 * G_[x,t] + 
               z * sigma.B/2M * G_[x,t] + delta_[t,0] * delta_[x,0] }

   and

   G_[x,t] = 0 , t <= 0


   To this end, we have proceeded to the following changes:

   2.1  In mainprogram.f90 we have requested iaction = 7, which will lead to unimproved derivatives
        and fields ( imp = .false. ) and to the desired evolution equation ( iform = 4 ).

   2.2  In mainprogram.f90 we have set all cset(2,:) = 0 except cset(2,5), as this one corresponds
        to the sigma.B term which we want to retain.

   2.3  In heavypropagators.f90 we have defined zfactor with obvious meaning.

   2.4  In heavypropagators.f90 we have defined iform = 4 to implement our evolution equation
        without messing up the existing ones. This works as follows:

        Gtot will accumulate  : ( 1 + DD/4M ) * ( 1 + DD/4M ) * G_[x,t]
        
        Ghelp will accumulate : sigma.B/2M * G_[x,t]

        Then we add them: Gtot = Gtot - z * Ghelp

        And we multiply the result by the temporal link U4_[dag;x,t]
