This version of the code includes, apart from 1s0, the three 3s1 states.

The sample.out has output that corresponds to the configuration:

"../code_v0.0/RC16x32_B1830Kud013760Ks013760C1761-1-000410.delime.testlat"

which is what has to be supplied as input when running the code.

The plaquette and 1s0 state have to match exactly the 0.0 version of the code.
