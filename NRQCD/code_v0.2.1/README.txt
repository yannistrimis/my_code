Version 0.2.1

This version of the code includes, apart from 1s0, the three 3s1 states.

The difference between this version and 0.2 is that this version
can accommodate different precision for the gauge configuration
and the complex operations (i.e. KC vs KC_CONFIG).

The sample.out has output that corresponds to the configuration:

"../code_v0.0/RC16x32_B1830Kud013760Ks013760C1761-1-000410.delime.testlat"

which is what has to be supplied as input when running the code.

The plaquette and 1s0 state have to match exactly the 0.0 version of the code.
