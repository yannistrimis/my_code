This version (1.0) is developed for comparison against PRD 91 054511 (2015)

Remarks :

	If the code is compiled in double precision the 6*plaquette matches
	MILC plaquette up to 10 significant digits.

Additions and changes:

1st batch:

userparameters.f90 :

	Precisions KI, KR, KC can be set to double (8) or single (4). Precision 
        of the configuration itself is always single (KC_CONFIG=4)

gaugefields.f90 :

	Remove endianness flag from open() function.

	The configuration is saved as Uraw_temp and the conversion to 
        double, if needed, is done through 
        Uraw() = cmplx( Uraw_temp(), kind=KC )


mainprogram.f90 :
	
        Call corrfile_<state> to write the meson correlators
        
        In call of configreadshift() argument 0 is passed as 0_KI

        In call of heavyprop() argument 1 is passed as 1_KI

heavyoperators.f90 :

	Added ^3S_1 state for x,y,z Pauli matrices.
