0.1   THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO OVERWRITE THINGS IN THE OUTPUT DIRECTORY
      SO MAKE SURE GUARD FILE AND ${file_name} ARE PROPERLY NAMED.
0.2   ALSO IMPORTANT: RUN AND SUBMIT DIRECTORIES SHOULD BE UNIQUELY IDENTIFIED,
      SO THAT IN CASE MANY SCRIPTS RUN SIMULTANEOUSLY, THERE IS
      NO CONFLICT IN THE INPUT FILES !!!


1.  CHANGE PARAMETERS IN params.sh
2.  CHANGE JOB ID IN submit_script.sb
3.  TAKE CARE OF LATTICE NAMING CONVENTION IN make_input.sh
3a. TAKE CARE OF ${lat_directory} (yannis or alexei)
4.  TAKE CARE OF NUMBER OF TASKS IN control_script.sh AND submit_script.sh
5.  TAKE CARE OF NUMBER OF JOBS IN envelope_script.sh
6.  forget_corr IN BUILD SCRIPTS LEADS TO CORRELATORS BEING ALL RECORDED IN
    SINGLE OUTPUT FILE
7.  make_input_nd.sh WORKS BOTH FOR ndv3 AND nlpi2v2 BUILD SCRIPTS.

8.  IN spriptsl1632b6850x100a_nd OUTPUTS HAVE DOTS IN THE MASSES!!! LEAVE THIS AS IS BUT
    DON'T COPY TO NEW 

ANALYSIS

9.  THERE TWO SCRIPTS; ONE FOR DOING THE JACKKNIFE AND ONE THAT USES THE JACKKNIFE-BINNED
    DATA TO CREATE cosh EFFECTIVE MASS PLOT DATA.
